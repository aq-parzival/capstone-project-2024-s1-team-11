Server Setup Guide:

1. Install PostgreSQL and PgAdmin
2. Create a new database named "maths_rocks" in the database server.
3. Download the server code.
4. Inside the config.js file, replace username and password with your own username and password.
5. Open up a terminal, and change directory to server folder.
6. Run "npm install"
7. Run "node server.js"

After all these steps, you should see that new tables (Users, Topics, Rocks etc) will be created in your maths_rocks database.
